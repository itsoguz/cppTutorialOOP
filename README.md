This is a repository, where you can find a collection of source files developed according to C++ object oriented programming exercises.

Note: Regarding to the exercises, I haven't followed the solutions provided on the video. Instead I have re-implemented the solutions according to my own taste. Both my solutions and the video solutions achieve the same goal. It's just a matter of preference/taste.

004MyVectorClass: I have developed a MyVector Class, that replicates std::vector class from standard library. I have taken into account the case, where vector elements would be a class type, like std::string, std::list etc. instead of being only primitive data types like int, double.
